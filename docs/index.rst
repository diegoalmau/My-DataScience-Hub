Welcome to my Data Science Hub!
============================================

Hi there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm [Diego Almau], a data enthusiast, explorer of the unknown, and, occasionally, a Python whisperer. Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of data science, machine learning, and all things tech, here's a little about my journey and how I got to where I am today.

About Me
-------------------------------

.. template::

    - **Early Beginnings**: My first steps into data science were in high school, when I started takng and analyzing data for the soccer team to help the coaching staff.

    - **Education**: My economics undergraduate years gave me a wide array of statistical and mathematical tools to face data-related challenges. Here, I also discovered a great curiosity for exploring data of any type to proof or find new economic behaviours. 

    - **Current Endeavors**: These days I am looking towards polishing my knowledge of mathematics, statistics and computer science and apply these tools to financial markets by pursuing a Master's in Financial Mathematics at the University of Chicago.

A Spoonful of Humor and Curiosity
---------------------------------

Did you know that data scientists are great at parties? They can bring their own "plots"! And speaking of plots, here's a little data science curiosity: The term "machine learning" was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence. Yet, it took a good few decades before we could truly harness the power of machine learning algorithms to make sense of vast amounts of data.
